# Project 1: Network Vulnerability Assessment Using Nmap and OpenVAS

## Overview
This project focuses on identifying network vulnerabilities in a simulated environment using tools like **Nmap** for network scanning and **OpenVAS** for vulnerability assessment.

## Objectives
- Perform network discovery and service enumeration using Nmap.
- Identify open ports and vulnerable services.
- Assess potential security risks and provide remediation strategies.

## Tools Used
- **Nmap**: For network scanning and service discovery.
- **OpenVAS**: To identify known vulnerabilities in the target system.

## Steps Taken
1. **Network Scanning**: Used Nmap to identify active hosts, open ports, and running services.
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Performed a vulnerability assessment using OpenVAS on the identified services.
3. **Analysis and Reporting**: Generated a report detailing the vulnerabilities found and suggested remediation steps.

## Key Findings
- [Example: Detected 5 high-severity vulnerabilities, including unpatched software and weak authentication mechanisms.]
